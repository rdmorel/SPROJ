Senior Project

For my senior project at Bard College I chose to create a content-aware image resizing tool utilizing seam-carving techniques. I wrote it in Java using Processing 2.0 and OpenCV.
The goal of the project is to intelligently resize images to fit the given dimensions without disrupting salient content.
In cases where the image's size must be reduced, I used seam-carving. Where the image's size was increased, I used seam-insertion based on the same principles.

The final version is simply labeled "Final."
